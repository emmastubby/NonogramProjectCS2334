# NonogramProjectCS2334

This is a java application that allows the user to play a nonogram puzzle game and select from a few different puzzle options. 
I originally developed this project in the spring semester of 2022, and I have recently uploaded it to GitHub so that I can share it.

The application must be run with the JavaFX library.
